## 🤖 AI HUMANIZATION PROTOCOL

### Remove These Phrases
```
- "Raise your vibration"
- "The Universe will provide"
- "Just believe and it will happen"
- "Let's delve into"
- "It's important to note"
- "In this article, we will"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Transform your life"
```

### Manifestation-Specific Techniques
```
1. Share realistic timelines and experiences
2. Acknowledge that action is required
3. Include "what if it's not working" sections
4. Reference both spiritual and psychological aspects
5. Provide specific examples, not vague concepts
6. Include journaling prompts in every article
7. Address privilege and systemic factors
8. Recommend professional help where appropriate
```

### Voice Examples

**Good:**
"Here's the truth about manifestation: it's not about sitting on your couch thinking positive thoughts and waiting for money to appear. It's about getting clear on what you want, doing the inner work to believe you can have it, AND taking aligned action. Sometimes that action is uncomfortable. Sometimes results take longer than we'd like. But when you combine genuine belief shifts with practical steps? That's when things start moving."

**Bad:**
"The Universe is always listening to your vibrations! When you raise your frequency to match your desires, abundance will flow effortlessly into your life. Simply believe, and you shall receive!"

## 🔍 COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE PROTOCOL

### Competitor Research Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Top 10 Competitors**
```javascript
// Search for top ranking sites in niche
exa_search({ 
  query: "manifestation guide guide tutorial", 
  numResults: 20,
  type: "keyword"
})

// Extract domains, analyze with Ahrefs/SEMrush data
```

**Step 2: Analyze Competitor Content**
```javascript
// For each competitor, scrape their top pages
web_fetch({ url: "https://competitor.com/sitemap.xml" })

// Analyze:
// - Content topics they cover
// - Word count averages
// - Publishing frequency
// - Content formats (guides, lists, reviews)
```

**Step 3: Find Their Weaknesses**
- Outdated content (check dates)
- Missing topics (gaps we can fill)
- Thin content (we go deeper)
- Poor UX (we make better)
- Slow site (we optimize)
- Missing schema (we implement)

**Step 4: Build Competitor Dossier**
```javascript
mcp_memory_set({
  key: "manifestandalign_competitor_intel",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    competitors: [
      {
        domain: "competitor1.com",
        strengths: ["...", "..."],
        weaknesses: ["...", "..."],
        topPages: ["...", "..."],
        backlinks: 15000,
        domainRating: 45
      }
    ],
    lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
  }),
  context: "manifestandalign"
})
```

### Outrank Strategy
1. **10x Content**: Make our content 10x better than theirs
2. **Content Freshness**: Update monthly, they update yearly
3. **Better UX**: Faster, cleaner, more accessible
4. **More Complete**: Cover subtopics they miss
5. **Better Media**: Original images, videos, infographics

---

## 🎯 KEYWORD RESEARCH WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Seed Keywords
```javascript
// Start with main topic seeds
const seedKeywords = [
  "manifestation",
  "manifestation guide",
  "manifestation for beginners",
  "best manifestation",
  "how to manifestation"
];

// Expand with Exa
exa_search({ query: seedKeywords[0], numResults: 50 })
```

### Phase 2: Keyword Expansion
```javascript
// Use AI to generate related keywords
mcp_ai_generate({
  prompt: `Generate 100 keyword variations for "$manifestation". Include:
- Long-tail keywords (4+ words)
- Question keywords (how, what, why, when)
- Comparison keywords (vs, alternative, better than)
- Commercial keywords (best, top, review, buy)
- Informational keywords (guide, tutorial, learn)

Format: One keyword per line, no numbering.`,
  provider: "anthropic"
})
```

### Phase 3: Keyword Qualification
Score each keyword on:
- **Search Volume**: Estimated monthly searches
- **Competition**: Low/Medium/High
- **Intent**: Informational/Commercial/Transactional
- **Relevance**: How well it fits our site
- **Monetization**: Can we make money from this?

**Scoring Formula:**
```
Priority Score = (Volume * 0.3) + (LowCompetition * 0.3) + (Relevance * 0.2) + (Monetization * 0.2)
```

### Phase 4: Keyword Clustering
Group keywords into topic clusters:
```
PILLAR: {Main Topic}
├── Cluster 1: Getting Started
│   ├── keyword 1
│   ├── keyword 2
│   └── keyword 3
├── Cluster 2: Advanced Techniques
│   ├── keyword 4

## 📊 CONTENT GAP ANALYSIS

### Find What Competitors Rank For (That We Don't)

**Step 1: Export Competitor Keywords**
```javascript
// Use Ahrefs/SEMrush API or manual export
// Get all keywords competitor ranks for in top 20
```

**Step 2: Compare Against Our Rankings**
```javascript
// Cross-reference with our Search Console data
// Find keywords where:
// - Competitor ranks, we don't
// - Competitor ranks higher
// - High volume, low competition
```

**Step 3: Prioritize Gaps**
```
Gap Priority Matrix:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│                 │ Low Compete  │ High Compete │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤

│ Low Volume      │ PRIORITY 2   │ PRIORITY 4   │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Step 4: Content Gap Report**
```javascript
mcp_memory_set({
  key: "manifestandalign_content_gaps",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    priority1: [
      { keyword: "...", competitorRank: 3, volume: 5000, difficulty: 20 }

FROM wp_posts 
WHERE post_type = 'post' AND post_status = 'publish'
ORDER BY word_count DESC;

-- Find posts without featured image
SELECT p.ID, p.post_title
FROM wp_posts p
LEFT JOIN wp_postmeta pm ON p.ID = pm.post_id AND pm.meta_key = '_thumbnail_id'
WHERE p.post_type = 'post' AND p.post_status = 'publish' AND pm.meta_value IS NULL;

-- Get posts with specific meta value
SELECT p.ID, p.post_title, pm.meta_value
FROM wp_posts p
JOIN wp_postmeta pm ON p.ID = pm.post_id

3. Use contractions everywhere (it's, don't, we're)
4. Add parenthetical asides (like this one)
5. Include specific numbers and examples
6. Add rhetorical questions
7. Use "you" and "your" directly
8. Include personal observations where appropriate
9. Break "rules" occasionally for effect
10. Add humor where appropriate for the site
```

### Humanization Prompt Template
```
Rewrite this content to sound natural and human:

REMOVE:
- All phrases from the red flag list
- Repetitive sentence structures
- Overly formal language
- Generic statements

ADD:
- Varied sentence lengths
- Contractions
- Specific examples with real details
- Direct address ("you")

## 🎨 VOICE CALIBRATION EXAMPLES

### Good vs Bad Content Examples

**Good (Humanized):**
```
Look, setting up a smart home doesn't have to cost a fortune. I've tested dozens of budget devices, and honestly? Some of the $20 smart plugs work just as well as the $50 ones. The main difference is usually the app experience and how well they play with other devices.

Here's what I'd actually recommend starting with...
```

**Bad (AI-sounding):**
```
In today's rapidly evolving smart home landscape, consumers are faced with a plethora of options when it comes to budget-friendly smart devices. It's important to note that price doesn't always correlate with quality. Let's delve into the most cost-effective solutions for your smart home journey.
```

### Voice Calibration Prompt
```

## 📧 SYSTEME.IO BROWSER AUTOMATION

### Why Browser for Systeme.io
```yaml
API CAN'T DO:
  - Edit email content in sequences
  - Create automation rules
  - Design email templates
  - Set up funnels
  - Configure webhooks in UI
  - Advanced segmentation
  - A/B test setup

BROWSER CAN DO ALL OF THIS!
```

### Systeme.io Browser Workflows

#### Create Email Sequence
```python
def create_systeme_sequence(sequence_name, emails):
    """
    Create complete email sequence via browser
    
    emails = [
        {"subject": "Welcome!", "content": "...", "delay_days": 0},
        {"subject": "Day 2 tip", "content": "...", "delay_days": 1},
    ]
    """
    steel = SteelFallback()
    steel.start_session()
    
    # Login to Systeme.io
    steel.navigate("https://systeme.io/login")
    steel.type("input[name='email']", SYSTEME_EMAIL)
    steel.type("input[name='password']", SYSTEME_PASSWORD)
    steel.click("button[type='submit']")
    
    # Create new automation
    steel.navigate("https://systeme.io/automations/new")
    steel.type("input[name='name']", sequence_name)
    
    # Add each email
    for email in emails:
        steel.click(".add-email-action")
        steel.type("input[name='subject']", email["subject"])
        steel.type(".email-body", email["content"])
        
        if email["delay_days"] > 0:
            steel.click(".add-delay")
            steel.type("input[name='delay']", str(email["delay_days"]))
        
        steel.click(".save-email")
    
    # Activate
    steel.click(".activate-automation")
    steel.close()
```

#### Add Contact to Tag
```python
def add_contact_with_tag(email, tag_name):
    """Add contact and tag when API fails"""
    steel = SteelFallback()
    steel.start_session()
    
    # Login

    # Save
    steel.click(".save-contact")
    steel.close()

## 🧠 BROWSERUSE AI AGENT

### When to Use BrowserUse vs Steel.dev
```yaml
Steel.dev (Simple, Fast):
  - Known workflows with exact selectors
  - Repetitive tasks
  - Form filling
  - Data extraction

BrowserUse (AI-Guided):
  - Complex multi-step tasks
  - Dynamic pages
  - Unknown selectors
  - Research and exploration
  - When you need AI to figure out the steps
```

### BrowserUse Integration
```python
import browseruse

BROWSERUSE_API = "YOUR_BROWSERUSE_API_KEY"

async def ai_browser_task(task_description: str):
    """
    Let AI figure out how to complete the task
